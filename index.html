            <p class="blurb">Hello! My name is Maria De La Luz but you can call me Maria. In industry that is what I go
                by, meanwhile my family knows me as Lucero or Luz which means bright-star&#128171; for the former and
                light‚òÄÔ∏è for the latter in Spanish; so my name in English translates to Maria of the Light. I was born in
                San Luis Potosi, Mexico but I grew up in Northeast Minneapolis. Spanish is my first language even though
                I have the BIGGEST Minnesotan accent. ‚öõÔ∏èFUN FACT: I have been listening to STEM lectures, in particular
                Chemistry, since before I was born - my mom studied in the STEM field while she was pregnant with me. My
                love for the STEM fields is what lead to me to explore the Life Sciences and become a Chemistü•º. I've
                been able to conduct research utilizing microwave reactors to optimize the Fischer Indole Synthesis; a
                chemical reaction that produces an Indole which is the backbone to my favorite neurotransmitter -
                Serotonin! This experience introduced me to the field of Bio-Chemistry and opened up the door for me to
                conduct research in the Chemistry department at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities synthesizing‚öóÔ∏è a
                small-molecule inhibitor to probe BPTF binding interactions via photocrosslinking. After taking a detour
                post-graduation to work for the Minnesota Technology Association I realized that I want to apply the
                "Technology" sector of STEM to the Life Science Industry. Ultimately those experiences lead me to start
                working at BioTechne as a Research Associate in the antibody purification department and join this
                bootcamp. This brings me to my second üß™FUN FACT: prior to joining the Full-Stack bootcamp I was
                purifying subunit 1 of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. <br>
                <br> I have moved on from lab back to administration. Currently I get to credential all of the Medical
                Doctors, Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners at the Minneapolis Heart Insitute.
                Aside from my involvement in the STEM industry. I have many different hobbies and interests ranging from
                drawing and photography to attempting to build my own spectrometer for horticulture purposes and brewing
                kombucha. My life companion, ride or die, partner-in-crime, and fur-baby is named CaLu - unfortunately
                she's not named after the elements, Calcium & Lutetium - she is named after me (Lucero/Luz) and my
                ex-husband. Plants are a big part of my life. Currently I have over 50 different species of plants. My
                prized plants are two Plumerias and a Dendrobium orchid I brought back from Hawaii last year. If you
                want to talk plants ‚û°Ô∏è <a class="HMU" href="https://www.instagram.com/c12vida_/" target="_blank">
                    @c12vida_</a>. I'm always looking to learn new tips/tools to take care of my plant babies üå±üå± and
                also share what I have learned. As I work on developing projects through this course feel free to enjoy my photography work, under the "Work" section, as place holders for project cards.
